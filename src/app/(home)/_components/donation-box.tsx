      <p>
        The tools on this site are completely free to use and that will never
        change. I do this as a hobby and for my love of the game and I want to
        help the community with my creations. While most of the time there are
        practically no operation costs involved in running the site, I am more
        than willing to pay for the occasional costs out of my own pocket.

        The best way for you to support the site is to report any issues that
        may arise while using the tools or suggest new features and tools that
        you would like to see.

        I don't expect any monetary compensation for these tools, but if you
        really want to support what I do, you can buy me a coffee using the link
        below. Your support is greatly appreciated!
