          This tool allows you to simulate the probabilities of each item's
          placement in the inventory management events (e.g. Aoi's event).
        </p>

        <p className="text-muted-foreground">
          <strong>Note:</strong> While the tool does have some biases and
          multiple checks in place to finetune the probabilities, at the end of
          the day, it can still result in false positives, especially when the
          board contains many small items. Use the results as a guideline, not
          as a guarantee.

        <div className="prose dark:prose-invert max-w-full">
          <ol>
            <li>Select the event and round from the preset.</li>

            <li>
              Click <strong>Simulate</strong> to get the item placement
              probabilities.
            </li>

            <li>
              Go into the game and uncover the tile with the highest
              probability. You can uncover more, but I recommend you only do one
              to minimize the risk of using currency on false positives.
            </li>

            <li>
              If you see part of an item, carefully uncover the tiles around it
              too.
            </li>

            <li>
              In the simulator, place the item you uncovered in the previous
              step using the buttons below the board. If you haven't uncovered
              anything, just click on the tile you uncovered. Your board on the
              tool should always match the in-game board.
            </li>

            <li>
              Rinse and repeat until you uncover all the items from this round.
            </li>

            <li>
              When you're done with the round, select the new round from the
              presets and repeat the process.
            </li>
