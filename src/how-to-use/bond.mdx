The Relationship Rank Calculator tool can be used to calculate the relationship
rank of a student based on what gifts you give to them.

## Getting Started

To begin, select a student using the **Select Student** dropdown. Once selected,
you'll be able to set the current relationship rank of the student using the
input field under her portrait. If you don't own the student yet, just leave it
at rank 1.

The tool will display a small icon in the top right corner of every gift the
student likes, depending on how much she likes it. Under each gift, you can set
the number of gifts you own or want to give to the student. Clicking on an input
field will automatically select it and you can use the up/down arrow keys to
increment/decrement the value. Once you update a value, it will automatically
calculate the relationship EXP and rank of the student.

You can click on a gift's icon to see which students like it and how much EXP
each student will get for it.

## Options

The options for the tool are located under the student selector once you select
a student. The following options are available:
- **Only Display Favorite Gifts**: Will only display gifts that the student
  likes. This is useful if you don't intend to give the student any gift that
  she doesn't like. Please note that enabling this setting will not remove the
  gift counts you entered for gifts the student doesn't like and those will
  still be counted towards the total EXP.

## Troubleshooting

**Q:** The calculation seems wrong!

**A:** Bugs or incorrect data can always happen. If you notice a calculation
you're certain is wrong, please open an issue on [GitHub][github-issues-link].

**Q:** Blue Archive released a new student/gift and the tool doesn't have it.

**A:** I try to keep the tool up to date with the latest JP students and gifts.
But sometimes, life gets in the way and I can't update it right away. Please
check back later or - if I take weeks - pressure me about it somewhere.

**Q:** The tool doesn't have a certain limited edition gift.

**A:** I do not intend to keep track of limited edition gifts. If you want to
give your student one of these gifts, please change the count of one of the
bouquets in the tool instead (depending on the EXP value of the gift).
