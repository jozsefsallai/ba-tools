The Formation Display tool can be used to generate a clean, scaled, and
transparent image of a Blue Archive student formation (e.g. for use in YouTube
thumbnails).

## Getting Started

To begin, select a student using the **Select Student** dropdown. Once selected,
click on the **Add Student** button to add the student to the formation. The
tool will automatically figure out whether the student is a striker or a special
unit and place her in the correct group.

Once you've added all the students you want, you can change their attributes:
- **Level**: Once specified, the student's level will appear in the top left
  corner of her portrait.
- **Stars**: Star value which will be displayed in the bottom left corner.
- **UE**: The star level of the student's unique weapon. If provided, it will
  override the star value in the bottom left corner.
- **Borrowed**: If set to true, the "A" icon will appear in the top right,
  indicating that the student is a borrowed assistant in this formation.
- **Starter**: If set to true, the card of the student will get a golden border
  to indicate that she is one of the starter units in this formation.

**Note:** Changing a student's level, stars, and UE will also save these values
in your browser's storage, so next time you add the same student in a formation,
you won't have to re-configure these parameters.

You also have the option to move the student up and down in the formation using
the buttons on the right side of the student configuration area. This is also
where you can remove the student.

## Options

The tool also provides a few more options that you can play around with:
- **Scale**: Specifies the scale of the resulting image, going from 1x to 5x.
- **Display Overline**: If set to true, a line will be displayed above the
  striker and special student groups. This more accurately resembles how
  formations are displayed in-game, but it's disabled by default because some
  people don't like it.
- **Display Role Icon**: You may choose to not display the role icon of the
  student. Not sure why you'd do this, but the option is there.

Once you're happy with the formation, click on the **Download Image** button.
This will generate a transparent PNG image of the formation with the specified
scale and display a download popup once done. Please note that generating the
image may take a few seconds, especially if the image is massive.

## Export/Import

If you want to copy your student data (i.e. levels, stars, UE, etc. for every
student you've used with the tool) to another device or browser, you can do so
using the **Export cached student data** button. This will display a window with
a JSON object that you can copy and paste somewhere else using the **Import
cached student data** button.

## Troubleshooting

**Q:** The tool just hangs when I click on the **Download Image** button.

**A:** The amount of time it takes to generate the image depends on the number
of students in the formation, the scale of the image, and the browser you're
using. Ideally, it should never take longer than 15 seconds, so if you're
waiting longer than that, try refreshing the page or using a different browser.
You may also check the browser's developer console for any errors and let me
know about the error on [GitHub][github-issues-link].

**Q:** The image is not transparent or looks weird.

**A:** This is most likely a browser issue. The tool was developed and tested in
the latest versions of Chromium and Firefox, so try using one of these. I would
still appreciate it if you could let me know about the issue on
[GitHub][github-issues-link] (please specify the browser and browser version
you're using).
