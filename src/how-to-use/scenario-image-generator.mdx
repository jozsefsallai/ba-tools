The scenario image generator tool can be used to generate fake scenario/story
screenshots that resemble the ones you can see in Blue Archive. The tool tries
to replicate the in-game visual novel engine as closely as possible. This tool
doesn't currently offer a "playback" mode, so whatever you create here will act
like a screenshot you'd take in the game.

## Getting Started

Scroll down until you see the **Settings** section. Here, you can configure the
following settings:

- **Character Name**: The name that will be displayed above the dialogue.
- **Affiliation**: Optionally, you can specify the affiliation of the character.
  This will be displayed in blue text next to the name.
- **Dialogue Content**: The actual content of the dialogue. The text will wrap
  automatically, but you can also press enter to create a new line manually.
- **Font Size**: The size of the font used in the dialogue. Default is 41.
- **Background Image**: The background image that will be used in the scenario
  screenshot. It supports any modern image format. The image you select will
  automatically be resized and centered to fit the screen.
- **Display Buttons**: Whether or not to display the AUTO and MENU buttons in
  the top right corner.
- **Auto Enabled**: Whether or not the AUTO button should appear as selected.
- **Display Horizontal Line**: Whether or not to display the horizontal line
  between the character name/affiliation and the dialogue content.
- **Display Gradient**: Whether or not to display the gradient overlay of the
  text box. Note that disabling this can reduce the readability of the text
  depending on the background image you choose.
- **Display Triangle**: Whether or not to display the small blue triangle in the
  bottom right corner of the text box.

Additionally, you can add one or more characters to the scene. To do this, click
on the **Add Character** button in the **Characters** section. This will prompt
you to select a file with the character's image. Once selected, you can
configure the following settings for each character:

- **Sprite**: The iamge of the character, if you'd like to replace it.
- **X**: The horizontal position of the character in the scene relative to the
  scene's center. The anchor point is the center of the character's image.
- **Y**: The vertical position of the character in the scene relative to the top
  of the scene (with a bit of artificial top padding). The anchor point is the
  top of the character's image.
- **Scale**: The scale of the character's image (1 menas 100% scale). Supports
  decimal values.

You can also remove a character by clicking on the **Remove Character** button
underneath the character's settings.

Once you're happy with your creation, you can either **Copy to Clipboard** or
**Download Image**. These buttons are located at the bottom of the page.

## Where To Get Images

You can use any image you like as background or character images. If you want
Blue Archive-related images, I recommend using the [wiki][wiki-url].

- [CG (cutscene) images][wiki-cg-url]
- [Background images][wiki-bg-url]
- For character images, go to the character's page on the wiki and find a sprite
  in the character gallery.
